## About

A quiz game quickly made by me to play with my friends. Uses NextJs and Firebase firestore live database. This project was done in couple of days. In which I also managed to test 'Real-time database' (key-value version of Firestore), React ContextAPI.

Most of the pages were done in a rush, and are highly unoptimized at the moment (29.03.2020)

## Getting started

- Create a firebase app
- Rename config.example.json to example.json
- Replace blank API keys with your app's API keys
- yarn
- yarn dev
